# ReLodash

> Lets re-implement Lodash methods to understand JavaScript better

## Recordings

I am going to publish a video on YouTube with my thought process.

## Note about tests

I am using slightly enhanced Lodash tests for my functions, so in theory you can replace Lodash functions with one's from this repo.

## What it is not

- It's not a replacement for Lodash
- It's not meant to be used in production

**The main reason is not performance.** Although I think about performance while implementing these functions, I am not trying to intentionally make them faster or even as fast as Lodash.
