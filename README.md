# ReLodash

> Lets re-implement all lodash methods to get to know javascript better

## Recordings

I will record my though process on video and publish it on my youtube channel.

## Note about tests

I am using slightly enhanced lodash tests for my functions, so in theory you can drop-in any function from this repo instead of lodash version.

## What it's not

- It's not a replacement of lodash
- It's not ment to be used in production

**The main reason is performance.** Although I think about performance while trying to write these functions, I am not trying to make them faster or even as fast as lodash intentionally.
